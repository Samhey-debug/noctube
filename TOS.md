**Content**

Our Bot allows you to post, link, store, share, and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Bot, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting Content on or through the Bot, you represent and warrant that: (a) the Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (b) that the posting of your Content on or through the Bot does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other rights of any person or entity.

**Accounts**

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Bot.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Bot and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Bot or a third-party service.

**Termination**

We may terminate or suspend access to our Bot immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

**Changes**

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
